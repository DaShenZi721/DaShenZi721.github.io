Hi! Welcome to Shen Yuan's homepage!

I am a Ph.D. student at the [Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence](http://ai.ruc.edu.cn/), [Renmin University of
China](http://www.ruc.edu.cn/) (2021-Present), under the supervision of [Prof. Hongteng Xu](https://hongtengxu.github.io/).  

I received my undergraduate degree from the [School of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.scse.uestc.edu.cn/), [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/). 

My research interests include large language models architecture design, parameter-efficient fine-tuning and efficient Transformers.
